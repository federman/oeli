This R package contains some general utilities that I and maybe others find useful when developing data science software:

- Helpers for argument validation.

- Helpers to calculate density values.

- Helpers to work with Cholesky roots.

- Helpers to difference covariance matrices.

- Helpers to work with dates.

- Helpers to create a dictionary.

- Helpers to work with functions and its arguments.

- Helpers to estimate hidden Markov models.

- Helpers to work with indices.

- Helpers to create Markov chains.

- Helpers to work with matrices.

- Helpers to build an R package.

- Helpers for sampling.

- Helpers for storage of data.

- Helpers for timed evaluations.

- Helpers to catch exceptions.

- Helpers for user interaction.
