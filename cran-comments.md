I am very sorry that I have to send a new update to CRAN just two weeks since the initial release. The reason is that I added several functions that are needed in other R packages. I am aware that the packages at CRAN are checked by volunteers and that I am putting too much strain on their time with too frequent updates. Please accept this short-term update as an exception.

Also, an error occurred for the check results for r-patched-linux-x86_64 flavor (https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_oeli.html). This is fixed by this update.
