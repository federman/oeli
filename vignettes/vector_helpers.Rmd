## Split vector into chunks

Say we want to split a vector into three chunks of equal size:

```{r, chunk vectors type 1}
x <- 1:6
chunk_vector(x, n = 3)
```

Alternatively, we can split `x` into chunks of size `n = 3` by setting `type = 2`:

```{r, chunk vectors type 2}
chunk_vector(x, n = 3, type = 2)
```

Both somehow also works if `n` is not a multiple of `length(x)`:

```{r, chunk vectors uneven}
x <- 1:7
chunk_vector(x, n = 3)
chunk_vector(x, n = 3, type = 2)
```

To prevent such "odd" cases, set `strict = TRUE`:

```{r, chunk vectors strict}
try(chunk_vector(1:7, n = 3, strict = TRUE))
```
